Project completed during the 3rd year at ISEN Brest. It involves analysis, cleaning, and visualization of AIS (Automatic Identification System) data from ships in the Gulf of Mexico. Development of a web application with integrated AI models (clustering, classification, regression) to predict ship type and trajectory. Developed as a team of three students.

## 1. WEB COMPONENT DESCRIPTION (Final Version)

This web application is a platform designed to monitor ships using their AIS data. It integrates:
- A **MySQL database** for storage,
- A **PHP back-end** for business logic,
- A **front-end** in HTML/CSS/JavaScript for user interaction.

### Key Features:
- Adding new vessel data via a form.
- Visualizing the entire fleet on an interactive map.
- Analyzing vessel behavior using a Python model (`clusters.py`) that assigns a cluster to each ship.

## 3. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- MySQL database server
- PHP with `PDO_MySQL` extension enabled
- Python 3 (to run the AI scripts)

## 4. INSTALLATION & DATABASE CONFIGURATION GUIDE

Follow these steps in order for a successful setup:

### 1. **Upload the Project Files**
- Upload all project folders and files to your web server.

### 2. **Create and Populate the Database**
- Using **phpMyAdmin** or another SQL client, create a new MySQL database.
- Open the provided `ScriptSQL.txt` file.
- Copy and paste its content into your SQL console to create the necessary tables:  
  `bateau`, `releve_ais`, `statut_navigation`.
