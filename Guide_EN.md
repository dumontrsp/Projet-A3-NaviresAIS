This project was completed during the third year at ISEN Brest, as part of a team of three students.  
**Main objective**: to design a full-featured application for the analysis, management, visualization, and prediction of AIS (Automatic Identification System) data from vessels navigating in the Gulf of Mexico.

---

## Context and Objectives

This cross-disciplinary project is structured around three main areas:

1. **Big Data Processing**  
   - Extracting, cleaning, and analyzing raw AIS data files  
   - Handling large datasets from vessel transponders

2. **Artificial Intelligence**  
   - Modeling and classifying ship types  
   - Behavioral clustering  
   - Trajectory prediction based on historical data

3. **Web Development**  
   - Creating an interactive website  
   - Applying AI models to real data  
   - Providing a user-friendly and modern interface for data exploration

**Key skills**: data analysis, applied AI, and full-stack web development using:  
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Back-end: PHP, MySQL  
- Data exchange: AJAX, JSON

---

## Main Features

- **Vessel Management**  
  Form to register new vessels, edit or update information using a MySQL database.

- **Tables and Visualization**  
  Dynamic table of vessels and interactive map (Mapbox + Plotly).  
  Filter-based search, click or hover to display detailed information.

- **AI Predictions**  
  Trigger Python scripts (classification, clustering, trajectory prediction) directly from the web interface, and view the results instantly.

- **Statistics and Summary Views**  
  Simple visualizations: histograms, distribution by vessel type, port usage, etc.

- **Clear Code Structure**  
  Separated code layers:  
  - Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
  - Back-end: PHP  
  - AI scripts: Python  
  - Database: SQL files  
  Well-commented file structure to improve clarity and maintainability.

## Project Organization

- Collaborative work in a 3-person team  
- Project management using Gantt chart  
- Version control and code sharing via Git  
- Deliverables included:  
  - Commented source code  
  - Design mockups and visual guidelines  
  - Database schema  
  - Installation scripts  
  - Technical analysis report

**The application is standalone** and can be deployed on any PHP/MySQL compatible server. Python scripts can be easily connected.

## Additional Information

This repository contains only the web component (front-end and back-end).  
Advanced work on Big Data and AI processing, along with the cleaned datasets, is available upon request for those interested in the technical details.
